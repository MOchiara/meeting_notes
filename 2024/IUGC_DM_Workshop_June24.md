# IUGC June 2024 Data Management Workshop

Several break out sessions took place to get wide ranging feedback on the following topics  

## The release and adoption of the OG 1.0 data file format: its role and future development (e.g. including technical data, more generic data types like sound, imagery, vectors). How can the OGDMTT help? (Dan)


 



## A strategy for delayed mode workflows (PI – DAC – GDAC), how to feed other repositories such as EMODNet. (Victor)



## The role of open-source tools to leverage data management knowledge and capacity across communities. Updates in technology such as federation or cloud services. (Callum)



## The harmonization underway for command and control (C2) systems for mixed model and mixed mode fleets. Future plans and priorities. (Alvaro)




## Break out on quality control and quality assurance (Justin)
QA/QC covers different levels
Real time automated QC to remove gross outliers for operational oceanography community (Real-rime/R-mode). Data downloaded from platform is another version of this and is known as recovery mode.
Automatically adjusted data for known issues e.g. pressure or oxygen correction based on sea surface values  (Adjusted/A-mode)
Climate grade data after human inspection and calibration (Delayed mode/D-mode)
Mixed (M) mode would cover a deployment
This does not correspond cleanly with existing data sate indicators used in Felds like satellite products but does map to with other networks like Argo. This is a topic that could be looked at the the Ocean Coordination Group for cross network harmoinsation.
 
The need for guidance materials on QA/QC was clear with OceanGliders acting as a facilitator to connect users to guidance. Re-establishing a community manager would be highly beneficial as a community manager would act as the bridge between users and glider best practices/guidance. Such a person would eb a facilitator, communicator and motivator within the community to reinitiate and sustain the best practices and development of guidance in the OceanGliders communicator.
 
The guidance should also extend to the overall data workflows and data assimilation approaches to take account of factor such as time of day or night.
 
The new glider data assimilation task team are keen to work across task team to progress the work collaboratively.
 
How to reduce the delays in the submission of delayed mode data to DACs was discussed. This is for a number of reasons including immature delayed mode methods and apprehension by PIs that the data are not finished/perfect. Guidance is needs to document the expectations on delayed mode process and the QC level of data with intermediate versions possible that include the provenance to ensure any reuse it within the bounds of what would eb acceptable at the intermediate data state



### Not covered 
The potential funding opportunities that could support the above, and the value proposition we can bring: can we describe costs of not proceeding on the above qualitatively or quantitatively? Can we clearly identify improved FAIRness for each improvement made? (Justin)
The role and further specification or development of controlled parameter vocabularies for glider scientific and technical data. (Emma) 
Prioritization and organization of efforts to address the above, or any other topic brought by the attendees, and how OGDMTT may help in the short (1 year) and long (5-10 year) time frame. (?)

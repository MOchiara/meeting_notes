# OG meeting: profile splitting

This will be to discuss how we assign sequential identifies to segment an OG format glider file into individual vertical sections (ie dives/yos/profiles) and what nomenclature we will use for this.
Attendees have been asked to prepare recommendations of how to perform this assignment. This should preferably be based on the PHASE variable we discussed at the last meeting,
so that it can be assigned automatically as part of an nrt processing pipeline.

Here's one suggestion for incrementing SEGMENT each time the glider surfaces and PROFILE each time it inflects [https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual/pull/276](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual/pull/276 "https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual/pull/276")

SEGMENT_NUMBER: SEGMENT_NUMBER is 1 at the start of a deployment. SEGMENT_NUMBER increments by 1 each time the glider enters the surface phase (PHASE=3)”;

PROFILE_NUMBER: "PROFILE_NUMBER is 1 at the start of a deployment. PROFILE_NUMBER increments by 1 each time a glider enters a dive or climb phase (PHASE = [1,2])”;


advantages:
- Easy to calculate, as it depends soleley on glider PHASE
- Monotonically increasing by definition: no nans, no part of the glider timeseries left unclassified
- Flexible to hybrid modes like multidive, gliders that travel laterally under thrusters between/during dives.

disadvantages
- Does not neatly split the glider dives at apogee/pergiee. Just when the glider completes its surfacing/bottom turn manouvres
- Does not define paired up and down profiles (what might be called a full dive cycle) to analyse e.g. hysterisis

### to discuss

- Is this method useful? Or do we have alternative suggestions?
- Do we define segment, profile. dive, yo?
- How do we align with e.g. argo?
- How do we accommodate delayed mode/scientist defined profile numbers?

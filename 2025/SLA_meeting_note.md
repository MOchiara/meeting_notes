# SLA discussion OceanGliders / OceanOPS - Meeting Note

## 1. Collaboration with Dalhousie University
	- Bradley DeYoung discussed previous collaborations with Dalhousie University, particularly with the Ocean Tracking Network.
	- Laurent Mortier mentioned that Anibos is looking for support and that there is potential for collaboration with Dalhousie University.
	- Bradley suggested stimulating connections between Anibos and OTN.

## 2. OceanOps Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
	- Jon Turton presented the three levels of services from OceanOps: baseline core service, standard package, and advanced services. 
	- The baseline service requires a minimum metadata input from networks, while the advanced services offer dedicated coordinators.
	- Funding requirements for new networks were discussed, estimating $20,000 for setup and $5,000 annual running costs.

## 3. Funding and Support for Ocean Gliders
	- Victor Turpin highlighted the anticipated support from the US, estimating $21,000 to $22,000 annually from 2025 to 2027.
	- Bradley DeYoung provided context on US funding, noting its relative security despite political changes affecting NOAA.
	- Laurent Mortier discussed the in-kind support for ocean gliders through the funding of Maria Rita's salary.

## 4. Coordination Among Glider Community Entities
	- Victor Turpin emphasized the need for coordination among UG2, EGO, and Ocean Gliders to enhance collaboration.
	- Laurent Mortier mentioned a document mapping the roles of different entities in the glider community, which is ready for circulation.
	- Bradley DeYoung suggested a meeting to discuss how these entities can work together effectively.

## 5. Current Status of Ocean Gliders
	- Victor Turpin reported nearly 3,000 missions registered under OceanOps with harmonized metadata.
	- The team has developed specific tools for OceanGlider and is partially monitoring GTS and GDAG data.
	- Victor highlighted ongoing participation in various working groups and community development efforts.

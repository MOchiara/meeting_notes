3) Discussion


## Live Notes
Victor: gives presentation, outlines problems related to the Chla data pipeline

Victor: Makes sense to get inspired by Argo

Catherine Schmechtig:

Outlines RTQC Chla for Argo
3 QC applied in RT :
1 - correction of black (zero values at depth)
2 - non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) -> lower values during daytime of chla due to in vivo dynamics of chla (adaptation of organisms to light)
3 - Slope correction (factory calibration) can change from one region to another : mean value of 2 is taking into account globally despite some regional variability

Meta data (coeff and equation) is stored in nc files (factory and scientific (ie adjusted) dark and slope coefficient)

bbp (2015 : agrees on equation, 2016/2017 : reprocessing of data at GDAC level by Antoine Poteau, 2018 : feddback by manufacturor)

BBP RTQC tests developped in framework of EuroArgo-RISE project (G. Dall'Olmo)

Justin Buck : Does the sclae factor issue identifed in Argo also affect gliders?
CS knows from which SN the issue does not apply and will share it, we as a glider community will need to contact the manaufacturer for corrections prior to this serial number. 
ECO sensor after June 2018 -> NO require a new scale factor.
ECO sensor with serial number higher than 5090 -> NO require a new scale factor

S. Thomsen : we needed to take samples to quantify biomass (and so on). Cruise data is really key nearby the glider to analyse chla data from glider.

V. Turpin : different QC for fluorescence and chla. What is important for the operationnal oceanography?

P. Testor : RT and DM are different things, lets focus on RT.

Catherine Schmechtig: 3 steps for RTQC are the same between DMQC and RTQC. Most people are interested as Chla and few in fluorescence.

Justin: Are the documents which outline the different requirements for operational vs. scientific Delayed Mode community users of Chl-A data? 

Catherine S.: errors are key for data providers, potentially up to 100% in real time and 30-50% in delayed mode



Justin: We as a glider community need to learn from Argo, Argo has made huge progress, the final method aplied on gldier may differ slightly form Argo beacuse gldiers have a different sampling resolution but learning from Argo and sharing knowledge and appraoches is crucial (there is a cricital mass of knowledge and progress in Argo that we need to learn from).


Catherine: Argo have put a large amount of effort into BBP and this will need to be taken on board by gldiers too.

Catherine: The ratio of Chl-A and BBP is used to correct quenching, needs day and night profiles

Justin: It depends on how the glider is configured to sample, easier for shallow gliders that do more profiles.

Dave Hebert: Sets gldier to do day and nigth profiels to enable quenching corrections

Victor: Do we need to set requirements ofn piloting to enbale these corrections
Justin: Similar to the NRT doscussion yesterday, I think so.



Catherine: A new sensor with new excitation wavelengths on Chl-A is likely soon. Making sure we have sufficient metadata to capture this is key when they are introduced on gliders.


Victor: Re-introduced governance topic. What advice does Catherine have for gliders.

Catherine: Regularly share progress and issues. One person each DAC engaged in the process for Chl-A is important. Shifting representatives slows the process.

Soeren: Sustainabiltiy of people and knowledge is important. This is why documenting meetings is crucial. How can the transfer of knowledge be managed?

Catherine: Sharing presentations/minutes is key to keep track of decisions etc. Also, a repository to store development is being setup. More efficieny needed for BGC parameters, is a bit slower than T&S.

Soeren: Training of the community is key. Fundimental skills like formats and coding need to shared effectively. It is a long process though.

Callum: Agrees with Catehrine, Is there a plan with with GROOM for making minutes available.

Victor: Plan is to use the GROOM google drive for particpants, but need a way to link this tothe OG community repo.

Callum: Is it possible to make it broader than participants

Victor: We need to find and option for this


(Justin lost track of conversation briefly here so a gap in notes)


Soeren: suggested a closer collaboration with Argo and offered support on GitHub akin to the work he has led in gliders as per of EuroSea

CS: the community of expert user of Argo float pushed to simplify RTQC to simple things (no spikes QC for instance)


Justin: the relevant Quartod manual is year for the USA approach https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/handle/11329/263



Comments: 
Soeren: We have to get back to the authors (Filipa Carvalho, Sandy Thomalla, Thomas Ryan-Keogh, Tom Hull, Bastien Queste) of the DMQC overview paper chapter on Chla. They wrote a very nice 2 pager on key actions to be taken including key literature etc. The text is close to be ready to be publishable. I could share the google doc link here but maybe we should discuss this before? Pierre?

Soeren: Sophie Clayton is planning to develop a Chla SOP for OOI in the US. It would make sense to converge methods and connect and NOT reinvent the wheel again but build on existing work.

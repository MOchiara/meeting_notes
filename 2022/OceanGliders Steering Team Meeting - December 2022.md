## Meeting Notes
### The use of gliders in the INCOIS observing capacity
Dr. Rama Rao Pattahbi presented INCOIS observing facilities and the plan INCOIS have with regard to gliders.
INCOIS will grow fast with many gliders.The ambition to maintain gliders permanently on regular lines.
Presentation of. Dr. Pattahbi is available here: https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/meeting_notes/blob/main/2022/Pattabhi-Glider-SG.pdf

The sustained approach taken by INCOIS raise lots of interest from the OceanGliders steering team. The team is considering how to follow up with INCOIS.

INCOIS is keen to provide ocean information and services in RT for the two lines, East and west India

    Action: Discuss on how to follow up with INCOIS glider activity (BOON, Storm TT, support with data management and monitoring)?

### Reorganizing the task team approach
The current organization of the task team hasn't evolve since the launch of OceanGliders (despite the creation of the Ocean Health and Ecosystem TT and the Best Practices TT).

Some Task Team are dormant, some needs better reporting on acheivements.

Some suggestions:
- Improve web presence
- Define Co-leaders
- Request Annual report for TT leaders by the annual meeting.
- Encourage/Request regular meeting and reporting.
- Part time Contributors (remark from Dave).
- Define the objectives of a TT.
- Pierre Testor Suggested to define different requierments for technical Task teams (Data Management, Best Practices) and scientific task teams.

To better track progress of the task team, the steering team is considering 3 actions:
    
    Action: Open a call for new task team
 
    Action: (Re)define the OGST requierements/guidelines to the task team chairs. 
    
## How to progress toward archival and delayed mode data?

GOOS is monitoring the performance of its networks through different aspects. The delayed mode data management has been identify as a weakness of the OceanGldiers program in the previous assessment.

OceanGliders steering team should ask the OceanGliders data management team to progress on this.

    Action: "Official" request from the OceanGliders Steering Team to make progress of delayed mode data management. 

The quick survey made during the meeting show high variability in the level of delayed mode data management.

Filipa Carvalho emphisise that DMQC is not about resolution but request expertise from glider groups.

IMOS is DMQCing all its data set after 3 months of the recovery of the glider.

OOI is calling delayed mode data the recovery data.

Spray community as many others are doing its internal delayed mode quality control and publishing the full DMQC data set of an observatory with a DOI.

Pierre Testor suggested that the Github community should be used to collect information and report about the status the delayed mode QC for gliders.

    Action: Survey the OceanGliders community to identify the status of delayed mode data management at the program level. 
    
    Action: open a repository on delayed mode quality control for gliders on Github.
    
## Linking OceanGliders with the Decade activities (GOOS C-Design, OceanPredict, CoastPredict...)

Many UN decade activities involving gliders exist and we would like to review who from the glider community is involved in those intiatives.

    Action: Review involvement of the glider community in UN Decade project. Ask volonteers for steering team to represent OceanGliders in the relevant UN Decade project.

UN Decade Project | OGST representative

GOOS Co-Design | 
OceanPredict |

## European Glider Meeting in 2023.
The European glider community is planning to organize a meeting in spring 2024.
Filipa Carvalho is leading the preparation of the meeting.

Lousie Biddle, Ilker Fer, Pierre Testor, Brad De Young, Robert Todd and Charitha Pattiaratchi are part of the preparatory team.

Shall OceanGliders work to organize rotating community meeting between the different regions ?

## Next meeting

Next steering team meeting is planned around June 2023.

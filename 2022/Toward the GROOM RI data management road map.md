# Meeting notes
## What does the road map should cover ?
Sylvie : Describe the users to serve.
Pierre: Internal needs and outside needs. Share with the participant.
Emma: 2 years. Include KPI / GTS and GDAC. 
Targets needed to fulfill user needs.
Kamil : Easier to start the discussion with the description of the road map. Use the description item in the conclusion (only).
Sylvie : we are in the same line. all good. Benefit from the GROOM-FP7. It was probably too technical and not enough high level to engege with more people.
Kamil : Maybe the critical mass has been acheived. More people involved.
Pierre : We would need exec summary, high level (driver, ressources, plan), to be diseminated more easily.
Emma : 
Dan : Community engagement is key. put this aspect in the road map. Get everybody aware and committed to be part of this. Plan on how to do that ? Improve engagement.

Sylvie : 2 documents road map: strategy. Where we have to go / Vision. Implementation plan : How to acheive that.

**Suggestion of structure**
1) Vision What are the drivers: Users requierments and risks
    + Then requierment from users.
    + Risk in not implementing the road map
    + Target
2) Implementation
    + Gap analysis
    + Then the steps
    + Then how to implement.

Vision +  Implementation (gap anlysis)
Do not stick to 2 and 5 years ?

Kamil. Training should be included in the implementation chapter.

Sylvie : Who are the actors in the system, role of each (OceanOPS, PI, OPe, DAC, GDAC). It helps to identify the cost. Option to organize the road map. 
BGC is doing this kind of exercice (Catherine S.). 

Kimmo : I am pro 2y/5y goals and mayby longer term goals too. It shows our abition to ourselves and also others what they are to expect and adobt in the future. We not the only ones who do decisions in the area. I hope that other players realize that they should take into account glider community and development we do. Clear timeline gives some backbone.

Catherine : Timeline Milestone is better than 2/5 years goals. Building on solid ground.
*get the document senarios of Catherine*

Pierre : Timeline imply ressources. Exemple of O2 : First step, strong system of metadata, then share data, then processing.

Emma : KPI, risk, how our system can scale?

Pierre: What would be the role of GROOM RI to manage that ? - Section 1. 

Sylvie : The team exist but they are invisibl and each one is doing the same things, facing the same issues. The Benefit limit this cost. Exemple of Argo should be studied.
Another risk is that yo may have difficulties in funding as you are not visible as a network with sustained services...This is the purpose of being an RI

Pierre : What could we develop in common under the umbrela of GROOM RI and EuroArgo RI.

Sylivie : I agree with Catherine on the timeline for implementation 
 I also think that, as the actors are sometimes  different some steps can progress in // : real-time are managed by DACS while Delayed mode involve scientists and at a latter stage the DACS
For metadata it will probably be more a sugroup of metadata specialist that already did this for other networks
Monitoring also evolve other team and will probably be more evolutif. In the roadmap you just mention that you need a monitoring system and it's mandatory requirements

VIctor : How do we connect to the funding deliverable?
Sylvie : DM is hidden in the cost plan. 10% of the cost of the RI as a basis. 


Sylvie : Add to the document : "First version of the road map that will be revisited in the framework of GROOM RI"

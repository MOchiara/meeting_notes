Chapter 2: Pre-deployment preparation

To lead / co-lead: Josh Kohut, (Alvaro Lorenzo Lopez)
To support: Victor Turpin (OceanOPS), NOC Glider Ops, and others TBD during the workshop          



Mission Planning
where/what platform is the glider being deployed from and *recovered*?
Mission planning tools?
including a science mission plan from the project science lead (how is this information shared?)
Is this institution specific (academic group, research facility, operational program)?
Some type of form/sheet that is filled out by the PI/scientist to give to the operator(s)/pilot(s) (if operator/pilot is not the PI/scientist) so they know the deployment track, what sensors, who is going on deployment, anything special/extra, etc…. maybe have PI and Glider tech/pilot all sign off on it before the glider prep starts (DAL & UNOLS forms examples) (can this be a global tool to submit a mission plan?)
Stages of planning (operator dependent?) (Adam Comeau) (Estelle Dumont)
Timeline of planning activity (very mission dependent)
Seek international collaboration for international missions (EARLY!!!)
Plan for time needed for shipping, customs etc as well as mission
Risk planning 
Insurance availability
Occurs after proposal, but before the mission specific planning
how to account for timing of the stages (i.e. proposal stage, or within weeks)
Dipclear Notice to Mariners (or equivalent)
Ask PhD/PostDoc to talk with technicians and everyone in the team what they plan to do
how many gliders needed for intended behavior (endurance line, station keeping, given ship availability)
include available vessels to respond in a region in case of an emergency (including the contacts)
endurance planning
Number of vehicles to support sustained observation (endurance line for example)
Stakeholders involved (can this be standardized?) (linked to global mission planner?)
Who to notify, with what level of information?
planned start/end dates 
authorizations? 
Advertise availability of a glider facility to new or inexperienced users
Roles during the mission and piloting rota
Area of operation (coastal, ice covered, open water, strong/weak currents, etc)
Required/Available vessels
Glider shipping 
how long will equipment be out of the lab 
glider availability (linked to glider facility setup topic)
consider capabilities of individual platforms, this could  include sensor availability, depth ratings … etc

Mission Logistics
Glider shipping (Aragon, Steve W)
How to ship (packing considerations)
International vs domestic shipping
custom clearance, avoiding importation tax, air vs ground for lithium batteries
Remote operations 
Dockside for small boat day trip
Aft deck/lab for ship based deployments  

The Glider Vehicle (Nicole Waite)
glider maintenance
routine maintenance (pumps, o-rings, etc.)
equipment/component life span
system upgrades
scheduling factory maintenance (it can take many months)
factory/manufacturer sensor calibrations?  Also takes months if you have to ship them internationally.
glider preparation (Steve W, Tania Morales)
when and how (platform dependent)
mission requirements (communication, duration, sensors, geographical area..., etc)
ballasting for expected water density in mission location
Stickers/signage
e.g. “Live Research'' - do not take out of water until a certain date” - include contact info.  In which/how many languages?
Check the last mission notes 

The Integrated Sensors (Theodore “Ted”, Albert Miralles)
How frequent should instrument calibrations be? - Reference SOPS and manufacturer recommendations (Theodore “Ted”)
Mention in mission planning and pre deployment checks (again referencing SOPs) - Potential cross reference with delayed mode chapter 
If you can’t get a sensor calibrated due to mission/money/time/instrument use constraints - can you verify that the sensor is still working properly? For example, if a CTD was calibrated a year ago, but hasn’t been used much since the calibration, can you verify that the CTD is still within spec by cross-comparing with another CTD that has been calibrated recently?(Theodore “Ted”)
Multiple sensor payloads to accommodate sustainable deployments and calibration schedules (Theodore “Ted”)
Sensors check (Albert Miralles)
(eg: Oxygen sensor 0 concentration and saturation point, referencing SOPs)
On bench test
Intercalibration (precise vs. approximate)
Manufacturer/factory calibrations or in-house? (Theodore “Ted”)
Best practice (including formats) for sharing this information? 


Chat: 
Victor Turpin - OceanOPS to Everyone (8:29 PM)
Agree with Pierre
Adam Comeau to Everyone (8:35 PM)
I agree with Nicole, thats happened to us to!
Jack Barth to Everyone (8:35 PM)
Nicole, that never happens :)
You're right, making sure everyone knows what the mission is key
Adam Comeau to Everyone (8:36 PM)
We’ve got a form we are going to start sending to PI’s to describe what plan they want. It’s a tricky balance between details and ease of use.
Nicole Waite to Everyone (8:37 PM)
if you could share that Adam, that would be great!. I've wanted to create something like that for a while.
Jack Barth to Everyone (8:37 PM)
The US UNOLS system has many forms for ship use; would be good to make this more formal for glider use
Nicole Waite to Everyone (8:37 PM)
when things get busy with lots of deployments, things get lost in communications sometimes
Me to Everyone (8:37 PM)
Please write these comments directly in the google doc it is easier to keep track
Jack Barth to Everyone (8:42 PM)
Gillian and others: please take a look at the "setting up a glider facility" topics (tab on Qiqo) and please join us tomorrow for that session

Chapter 3: Operations

To lead / co-lead:  Alvaro Lorenzo Lopez, (Josh Kohut)
To support: Gui Castelão, NOC MARS Gliders and others (TBD during the workshop). 
Sections / topics:

Launch and recovery  (Gillian, Steve W, Nicole, )
Toolbox talks - Training inexperienced ship crew, talk to officers, enlist other members of science party as helpers if only 1 or 2 glider people onboard.  And discuss recovery *before* deploying a glider in case of emergency.  
Immediate pre-launch glider and sensor tests and documentation thereof
launch and recovery technique/s, 
Go/ no go decisions (i.e. weather, team availability, vessel availability)
weather windows for deployment? Should you deploy if you don’t have an emergency recovery weather window within the first 24 hrs?
Different areas? (open ocean, polar areas, coastal environments, storms, fjords and channels…)
Emergency recovery/Vessel of Opportunity SOPs
lists of contacts in different regions
get the big bits back, don’t worry about breaking wings or other sticking-out bits
Different deployment/recovery platforms
Big ship
Small vessel
Rhib
Accommodations and travel to study site
In-situ validation or corrections (have a look at the DMQC chapter 5, have also a look to SOP Oxygen In situ intercomparison during deployment/recovery from a small boat)
Water sampling - sampling dive/climb/both. Surface sampling for oxygen? Temporal resolution and/or dissemination of data (transmit smaller data files for real time validation vs full length datasets post recovery)
concurrent profile data (niskin)
CTD cast / Multiparameter sonde
Number of Dive and Climb sampling for corrections
Piloting (Gilllian)
Types of mission: Long vs Short?
Piloting team models (Steve W)
Integrated group: Includes Scientists (faculty members …), PhD students and engineers/technicians. Most groups follow this model (provide examples).
Separated piloting group: This model has a dedicated group of pilots decoupled from the science. This model is usually followed by National, or Regional facilities that provide services to many groups. Also by companies subcontracted to do piloting.
one model involves an entire glider group - faculty, technicians, PhD students, postdocs - on a rota.  Communication via Slack (or equivalent).  Overview document explaining the planned mission, updated as necessary.  Daily handover containing standard information (including battery usage) plus comments about any unusual occurrences/problems.  Piloting log sheet recording all parameter/command changes with comments to explain.  Less experienced pilots receive training and co-pilot with more experienced for a time.  List of phone numbers to call at any hour of day if you have problems.
Some groups may only have 1-3 pilots total, which can create challenges when covering time off, holidays, weekends. Suggest having some back-up pilots to help cover those times. Are there other glider operators at other institutes that you can get pilot coverage support from when your pilot is on vacation (and offer support to)? 
Piloting phases (Estelle, Gillian)
Pre-deployment piloting
what happens locally on the deployment vessel vs remote
Regular checks
Recovery piloting
Communications 
WhatsApp etiquette! (lol leak :’()
Mission monitoring (Estelle) (Aragon)
KPIs
science sensor checks! (e.g. is the CTD pump working? Could/should sensors be turned off to save battery life in order to reach a planned recovery date?)
Custom code to analyse battery curves (voltage vs ampere) and others not available by default with SFMC or other piloting software (along with shared endurance results, lifetimes)
To achieve a specific behavior 
Constant behaviour 
Sustain transects
Station keeping
respond to features
consider interactions between piloting decisions and science, eg quiet running for PAM/microstructure
others?
Mission Emergencies
Piloting tools (Aragon)
Tools for interoperable piloting, piloting transparency
Manufacturer tool: SFMC, Basestation, Seaglider piloting tool, Glimpse and Spray tools (it used to be creating SBDs ages ago)
Institution Tools or Commercial systems for piloting or fleet control (operation portals, logging tools … )
Autonomous piloting: path planning, automatic trimming, condition monitoring, fleet coordination
Situational awareness: models, satellite imagery, bathymetri, vessel traffic data from other platforms, ai, ice, risk reduction techniques! ….
AIS (Marine traffic, vessels around)
WMS RT maps, updated AIS density MAPS, fishing activities (Albert Miralles)
Other tools
Create a system to keep track of what config (sample, flight, etc) files are currently on the glider. Easy way for a pilot to know what the glider is doing - e.g. when you put a new yo.ma file in the to-glider folder, also make a copy and call it yo.ma.cur to add to the to-glider file. Helps with pilot changes. 
Deployment webpages / SFMC pilot notes to record changes, alerts, problems, glider config/sensors, etc - can categorize (e.g. operations, informational, alert, action needed, action taken)
EGO/GFCP tool (Pierre)
Area of operation 
How do you manage piloting responsibility based on the area of operation
Coastal areas (Adam Comeau)
In coastal areas notable issues of concern center around ship traffic, fishing activity (particularly with drift nets or longlines), changing bathymetry and currents (tidal and persistent). To get information about these issues the following resources are suggested: marinetraffic.com, local departments of fisheries, coast guard, fishing docks, marinas and local oceanography departments if available.
Iced areas (presence of icebergs, retreating ice, packed ice, loose ice, under ice (UW and maybe others).
Open ocean  (Estelle Dumont)
Coastal-deep continuum (shelf break)  (Estelle Dumont)
Areas of high stratification (Adam Comeau)
Various oceanographic features can cause regions of high stratification which can prevent gliders from surfacing. It is important to always ballast gliders for the expected surface density range and account for thermal expansion differences between ballast water and local conditions. If operating in new areas sometimes the scientific literature has information on expected ranges of salinity and temperature.Increasing ballast drive, thruster usage  
Areas of strong currents (Eddies, coastal currents, tidal currents …) (Adam Comeau)  (Estelle Dumont)
Hurricanes? (Adam Comeau)
Best practices for sampling configuration (Aragon)
To enable formatting for NRT data to the GTS
To enable QA/QC e.g. key engineering variables for QC (per sensor recommended sensors, real and post time)
Recommended sampling strategies, intervals, duty cycles per sensor
Sensor collisions / interoperability 
Acoustic sensors measurements can be contaminated by the pumps operation, in this case we reduce the use of the CTD
Training (Tania Morales, Gillian)
Institutional training
Schools
Who needs to be trained and in what?
vessel crew
pilots
technicians
PIs????
Post recovery activities (Nicole Waite, Tania Morales)
Pre deployment checklist/information
Post deployment checklist/information
Post-mission report, automation (Albert Miralles)

Sensor validation
Ballasting 
How to record it 
Oddity/warning/abort analysis
Full dataset downloaded and archived
Submission of dataset to foreign states as per dipclear requirements

Documentation and Metadata (From original Chapter 2 List)
pre-deployment checklist/tests (Nicole Waite)
platform systems (compass, communications, etc.)
sensors (verify operation and calibration) (should this go into submitted meta-data? in some form?)
documentation (including required meta-data)
Packing? (everything in the boxes with auxiliary equipment)
Sensor calibration sheets
Best practice (including formats) for sharing this information (e.g. glider trim sheets)? (Victor Turpin)
Enable interoperability (through standardized)
What is important to include as meta-data
Minimum information requirements
Harmonized information (same vocabularies across glider groups)
Preferred information (i.e. what of the above outline should be included)
When are the meta data available 
Announcement before the mission announcing the important information relevant to the particular mission
Inform the GOOS metric requirements


Documentation metadata (From original Chapter 3 List)- (meekly Aragon, Gillian) (Nicole Waite, Victor Turpin)
Best practice (including formats) for sharing this information (e.g. piloting log, deployment/recovery information/etc)?
checklists/ballast sheets/etc pdf’s linked to deployment pages?
Mission failures / reliability analysis?, how to record
Deployment log notes - what segment/file contain the abort/failure. Can the data tell you anything?
How to diagnose or investigate after recovery? E.g. If a glider leaked, can you figure out where it leaked and why?
 How to get manufacturer data
Fault tracking at component level

Additional thoughts/Comments:

How do we capture best practices for non-ideal situations?
	In the conclusion of the paper?

How much to budget for ship time, or mission costs (linked to glider facility section)

Both in planning and during operations, we involve everyone from techs to profs in meetings and discussion, so everyone knows what the plan is in detail.


Discussion started with 'who' do we notify, then it progressed to 'what and when' do we notify.  Much discussion about UNOL/DAL mission plan.  Deployments for Rutgers don't go to web without metadata.  Sounds like a global tool for this to submit mission plans?  Would let other groups also know what operations are planned, when, and where.  PI's would have to roughly submit funding agencies, mission plans, etc.  Can an EGO tool be used to assist in all this? → Sure there are !

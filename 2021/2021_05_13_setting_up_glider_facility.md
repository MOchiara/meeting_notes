Note: Links can be made to other chapters as a summary of the range of activity that must be considered when setting up a glider facility (individual mission costs, shipping, data management, etc)

Introduction: matching the facility to user needs
Here we envisage an introduction that explains what this chapter sets out to do. ie. describe that the type of facility is determined by the user needs. (provide some examples). The rest of the chapter provides examples of some aspects that need to be considered (with regards to the type and function of facility / equipment and cyber infrastructure / technical expertise) in order to ease the journey and avoid pitfalls. Depending on your facility, parts below are or are not relevant. ie. user can decide which elements listed in this chapter are appropriate to meet their needs for the facility. Below are a list of bullet points provided by the community that are relevant to this section:

overall goals of the glider program (and available budget) drive equipment requirements and operations (Jack Barth, 
explicit statement of sampling capability, data availability; FAIR principles, applicability to EOV 
“uptime?” 80%; 
who are the users?
glider selection (Should we summarize these characteristics in a table?)(Olle Petersson, SeaExplorer) (Aragon Slocum) (Tania Morales Slocum, Seaglider, SeaExplorer)
required depth range, buoyancy displacement, speed, endurance, specific payload, payload combinations, rechargeable, cost, life span/upgrade/replacement etc.
Consider that requirements may change as science requirements change with new projects
Average age to EOL, version intercompatibility
Navigation accuracy?
User needs  / most likely mission requirements as it impacts what type of facility is needed. e.g. repeated lines, process studies maps, year-round, deployment/recovery vessels, shipping considerations (international, etc.)
Is a new facility the right option (vs. data as a service)? What is the threshold requirement?
stakeholder involvement from the beginning.  What do potential users want?  (Will probably need support of potential users to get funding for facility)
Although national facilities do add friction between the scientists and the operator centralising of facilities allows you to build critical mass to increase capabilities of both the facility and the gliders. There are definitely costs of having a national facility, but the benefits can if managed properly be more efficient for the community.
a hybrid model could work well - a collaborating network of smaller glider operators/facilities with larger operators/facilities. This will simultaneously promote diversity of expertise and retain the flexibility for specific project/programs, as well as allow for leveraging of the larger glider knowledge base and support community. (example: U.S. IOOS and regional RAs)
national facility that maintains and operates gliders for users/community - but very important to make sure the users/community know about the facility and the kind of science that can be done with gliders, otherwise can be under-utilised.
Consider the role of universities and infrastructure in setting up a lab?

Consider this point either at end of intro or end of chapter: The facilities (space/ technical expertise / equipment) ability to provide leverage for additional spin offs e.g. sensor development / technology innovation /  HCD for national needs etc.

1.  Introduction: matching the facility to goals and user needs
[Draft from Jack Barth, Oregon State University, based on notes from the Best Practices Workshop. I have not paid close attention to adding references and this will need to be done.]
The success of glider-based observing efforts relies on establishing an appropriately equipped, sized, and supported physical facility. Equally important is the creation of a well-coordinated team with expertise across the needed range of skills including knowledge of ocean science, funding opportunities, engineering, information technology, field operations, and outreach and engagement. Above all, the size of a glider facility, both its physical presence and the personnel team, should match the goals of the glider-based observing effort. These goals span from regular, full-time, 24/7/365 monitoring of ocean conditions along fixed sampling lines to provide data for use in numerical models and informing decisions, to short-term, sometimes intensive studies in support of basic research, short-lived phenomena like the passage of a hurricane or a Harmful Algal Bloom. Further, the type of gliders maintained and operated by personnel using a glider facility should be matched to the goals of the observing effort. Glider types vary widely in their ability to sample in shallow or deep water, carry out missions from weeks to approaching one year, in the number, size and interface requirements of ocean sensors the gliders can carry, and their ease of use. As with any ocean observing effort, the size and stability of the budget for facility setup and operations dictates many important choices. There are several, sometimes overlooked glider facility needs including an efficient and reliable information technology (IT) system, an infrastructure to ship and, in some cases, insure ocean gliders, and the ability to communicate about glider operations, goals and outcomes with a variety of interested groups including funders, policy makers, natural resource managers, students, and the interested public. In this chapter, we provide an overview of many of these needs as they relate to setting up a glider facility to insure a successful, glider-based observing system. We build on several excellent descriptions of glider facilities and operations including, but not limited to, GROOM (2014; 2015), Pattiaratchi et al. (Oceanography, 2017) and OOI (2012).
The overall goals of a glider-based observing facility will drive the desired characteristics of the physical facility, personnel team, and supporting infrastructure. Consideration of the potential users of a glider facility is best done from the very beginning of the design and creation of the facility. As with any ocean observing effort, the size of the available budget, both for one-time setup costs and recurring operations, plays a major factor in determining the size of the glider physical facility and personnel team. For some glider operations, the support of short-term deployments as part of scientific research programs or engineering developments will drive priorities. Other glider operations support long-term, full-time occupation of repeated sampling lines or regions in support of supplying ocean data for use in numerical modeling or ocean user decisions. These differing goals will dictate the choice of glider endurance, payload capacity, ease of deployment and recovery, etc. Another major decision is driven by science and operational goals associated with the required depth range, speed and maneuverability. Some gliders are optimized for shallow, coastal waters while others are designed for typical 1000-m operations, and with a few full ocean-depth gliders under development. The speed of glider inflection at the top and bottom of the glider’s climb and dive pattern, as well as its ability to change horizontal direction both impact how well the glider will be able to maneuver in a given ocean current environment.
The science and observing goals will dictate whether glider deployments and recoveries are done locally or within a about a day’s drive of the glider facility or, by contrast, the gliders will need to be shipped and operated at a remote, likely international, location. This has implications for the available deployment and recovery vessels and procedures, the ease and safety of shipping, and the required expertise needed on the glider team to navigate, for example, safe shipping and international customs rules. Another important consideration is the payload capacity and expandability of the glider for hosting additional oceanographic sensors. Some monitoring efforts focus on core Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) including temperature, salinity, pressure, and depth-averaged currents, similar to other large ocean observing systems like Argo floats and repeat ship surveys. Many gliders expand this core list to include some of the biogeochemical EOVs like dissolved oxygen, as well as proxies for phytoplankton biomass via chlorophyll fluorescence. Some gliders are designed for just these sensors and not much more, while others are capable of adding additional sensors inside and/or outside the glider pressure hull.
In addition to housing the physical equipment needed to support the choice of glider, described below, the level of data services provided will influence the size and extent of the glider facility and operational team. If the glider operations solely support the science programs and/or engineering developments of an in-house group of PIs and students, there is less need for real-time, quality assured/quality controlled data delivery to external users and entities, hence less need for members of the glider team dedicated to that activity. These glider facilities may still contribute data and ascribe to the FAIR data principles, but may do so by providing their raw data to a regional data assembly center. On the other hand, many glider operations are part of local, regional, national or international ocean observing efforts, ascribe to the FAIR data principles. and must support team members to carry out these data services.
One final consideration in choosing the type of glider and setting up a glider facility and personnel team is the desired level of “uptime.” The in-house capabilities for glider repair, upkeep, refurbishment and testing will lead to greater levels of uptime with the attendant greater cost in facilities and personnel. The responsiveness and physical distance – national or international shipping required or not – between the glider users and the chosen manufacturer will also contribute to the glider uptime and must be given serious consideration when setting up a glider facility.
Underwater gliders are becoming increasingly available in a diverse range of sizes, capabilities and cost, and from a range of manufacturers and nascent open-source efforts. While the majority of gliders operated worldwide are from the three early glider designs and suppliers, Slocum, Seaglider and Spray (ref), there are several other established (SeaExplorer) and emerging glider types. The type of glider to choose for a particular operation should be matched to the project goals as described above. Important considerations include required depth range, buoyancy displacement, speed, maneuverability, navigation accuracy, endurance, specific payload combinations and overall payload capacity, rechargeable or single-use batteries, cost, life span, and upgrade and replacement paths and costs. In addition, maintenance costs, average age to end-of-life, and the customer-manufacturer relationship and support system are also important. It is essential to realize that glider requirements may change as science requirements change with new projects and users, so flexibility to pursue these efforts should be anticipated. Finally, there can be both inertia and important equipment compatibility issues that favor a facility sticking with a particular glider type and manufacturer. While these are important drivers for consistency and ease and cost of operations, it may be advantageous for a glider facility to diversify the types of gliders it flies in order to serve a broad scientific and user base. For example, a glider facility might operate both a long-range, deep ocean glider with limited payload capability as well as a shorter range glider with greater payload capacity.
There are a variety of glider facilities in operation today and each has their advantages and disadvantages. Many of the early glider facilities were based at academic institutions, commensurate with the glider invention and early production coming out of the university environments. While academic settings afford great flexibility and are supported by university infrastructure for IT, shipping, insurance, etc., there are also disadvantages including an unstable funding situation and challenges expanding the physical footprint of a lab in a tight university environment. With gliders becoming more available and robust, new users will need to decide whether it makes sense for them to set up their own, standalone glider facility, to partner with a nearby, regional, experienced glider group, or to engage with a national facility that provides glider data as a service. The threshold requirements to commit to setting up a standalone facility are influenced by the availability of funding, membership in an ongoing ocean observing program, proximity to other experienced user groups, etc.
Another model is a national facility that maintains and operates gliders for users and the community. In this case, it is very important to make sure the users and community know about the facility and the kind of science that can be done with gliders, otherwise such a national facility can be underutilized. Although national facilities do add complexity between the scientists and the operator, centralizing of facilities allows critical mass to increase capabilities of both the facility and the gliders. There are definitely costs of having a national facility, but the benefits can, if managed properly, be more efficient for the community. A hybrid model could also work well, a collaborating network of smaller glider operators/facilities with larger operators/facilities. This will simultaneously promote diversity of expertise and retain the flexibility for specific project/programs, as well as allow for leveraging of the larger glider knowledge base and support community. For example, the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System with its glider data assembly center collaborates with the regional associations where gliders are maintained and operated.
In summary, a well-designed, well-equipped and appropriately sized glider facility can not only help support glider-based ocean observing but also provide leverage for additional activities like sensor development, technology innovation, a place for student internships and thesis projects.

2. Funding model / budget and sustainability

2.1 Funding model
Stakeholder: need to work with other departments (consider education/course work opportunities, external grants/contracts) 
how to “charge” users to support facility
single PI versus federal support/ core funding? 
Sustainability - Consider a long term strategy for operating a glider facility, particularly in academic environments where facilities are run out of universities. How to keep staff, lab space going? 
Will it be research or is it cost recovery or both?
figure out the cost of the facility and what the services would be to the university community / partners of the university

2.2. Budget and sustainability
BUDGET.  Capital
purchases of gliders/sensors/equipment for maintenance and refurbishment, building costs, insurance, plus ongoing costs - staff, consumables, communication! etc. and rejuvenation
budget considerations e.g. shipping costs minimum personnel requirements
describe different funding models
describe options of accessing funding / stakeholder buy in etc.
Considerations - things to consider when setting up a facility:
	will the facility provide shipping for missions around the world?
	will the facility provide a day boat for local deployments?
	will the facility be open to users at many different institutions?  If so, a charging model for users will be needed.  Even if it’s a one-institution facility, still need to understand costs of e.g. refurbishment, long-term sustainability of fleet, personnel, to include in grant applications.  (This bit highlighted in yellow is relevant to ideas about budgets, but it’s also relevant to section 1, matching the facility to the science.  What kind of facility are you setting up and what level/type of services does it provide?)

A glider use fee to have money for sustaining/maintaining/upgrading a glider fleet, - even in a university, if, for example, you have multiple PIs - especially when funded by grants - Grants usually do not include large impulses of money for upgrading glider fleets - so a glider use fee (e.g. of $x per 30 days at sea) is necessary to build up funds to keep your fleet going….You may also need to charge a fee for routine maintenance, eg replacement of Seaglider batteries after each deployment. (Nicole Waite)
	e.g. air bladder service, pump service, etc.
	e.g. gliders get old - and if you had a lot of money to set up a facility, but then stop getting large influxes - upgrading the fleet (or replacing gliders lost at sea), is very difficult. The glider use fees can help to buy replacements/upgrades as well.  

Funding of staff time for long-term activities which do not fall directly within the scope of a mission / project:
Platform / lab management
Team line management
H&S
Training

3. The Facility
brief intro describing that this section sets out a number of considerations to be kept in mind when setting up a facility tio guide / go to source of advice to give you a heads of things to think of / consider / keep in mind / what to avoid etc. to facilitate an easy path and avoidance of pitfalls that others have suffered. 


3.1 Location: 
Time response of the team in emergency cases considering the distance of the lab facility location, availability of ship, etc (Nadín Ramirez). 
concentration of expertise in one lab/national (i.e. you may want to place the facility where you have the biggest collection of user engagement and expertise / collaborators / access to other infrastructure, eg. ships)
location of lab/facility and any restrictions this imposes (eg are there cargo planes for shipping in lithium batteries, access to available tank for ballasting, access to deep water (or any water!))
allow for expansion (don’t lock yourself in physically as rapid expansion to multiple gliders likely, new sensors, different types of gliders, etc / close to academia?)
Consider the role of universities and infrastructure in setting up a lab?

3. Equipment

Glider infrastructure / equipment considerations
sensor spares
consideration of glider replacement / update glider fleet for long term sustainability…. if , and the consideration with rechargeable batteries (5 years charging lifes). mid life refurbishment.maintenance / life cycle
Sensor specific facility needs (for example, active acoustic calibration may require a larger tank -- 10m x 10 m x10 m-- facility than standard ballast tank).  Or consider whether another facility has the ability to test specific sensors.
equipment considerations (Aragon - minor, Nicole Waite)
What type of missions will be supported? Full-time occupations/one-off projects with multiple gliders/short deployments with complicated or power hungry sensors/long endurance deployments where battery life will be key
How will equipment be tracked throughout its lifetime and repeated deployments and what information is available as metadata? May require specific asset management software/db
How many gliders/components/spare parts are needed to maintain a full-time occupation? How do we define this? How many days apart between two missions? 
pressure tank?
Just a water tank for ballasting is v useful
Necessity for self-reliance on service/maintenance, sensor calibrations (to manufacturer or not) (ie: pressure chamber?)
in-lab sensors calibrations/intercomparisons
comment on usage of primary vs rechargeable or lithium vs alkaline batteries / more/less lab work and less/more ops at sea.
Lifting, hoists, carts (some glider types are getting larger)
Storage procedures for multiple vehicles and transporting internally

Cyber infrastructure

Cyber infrastructure. Sometimes is difficult to keep, maintain and evolve (Aragon minor, Tania Morales, Alvaro Lorenzo)
What levels. Is the facility going to maintain a data centre
Dedicated IT support?`
maintaining servers; 24/7/365; cloud based/virtualisation
Website for piloting plots and sending commands and manage metadata
Shared drives for log sheets/communication between piloting, etc
Cloud infrastructure. Need consideration on the funding (IMOS, UEA and others have done it)  (Note from UEA - cloud-based was cheaper than UEA-based server)
Software for fleet operation with different glider platforms instead of operating individual glider separately  
Should facilities adopt Open Source tools wherever possible (yes)?
Talking about piloting: the answer to these questions depends a lot on the decision of maintaining a dedicated IT infrastructure or letting the manufacturers take care of it (paying the corresponding fee) All kind of gliders can call to a server located in the manufacturer infrastructure which it can be convenient for small institution without IT infrastructure and teams. 
communications (satellite to shore, satellite, between teams)

In addition to the physical glider facility, there are important infrastructure needs to ensure a successful glider operation. These include an efficient and reliable information technology (IT) system, an infrastructure to ship and, in some cases, insure ocean gliders, and the ability to communicate about glider operations, goals and outcomes with a variety of interested groups including funders, policy makers, natural resource managers, students, and the interested public. These infrastructure needs may be supplied by either the glider team itself or by an institution that hosts the glider team and facility, but they must not be overlooked.
Information Technology
The Information Technology (IT) infrastructure includes hardware to host local compute, data storage and web hosting needs. These needs are modest so that relatively simple computer base stations/laptops can do the job. The glider team must have expertise in administering a glider basestation computer including keeping software up-to-date as manufacturers issue new versions of glider control software. These computer administration needs could be covered by the host institution IT department, for example at a central university IT group, but glider operational success depends on establishing a close working relationship with the central IT team. Since glider operations are 24/7/365, the time will come when there are IT needs outside of normal work hours. That close relationship between the glider team and central IT will come in handy at those times.
Following best practices, there should be redundant glider data and software storage systems, with at least one storage location at another physical location in case of catastrophic loss, for example by fire, at the primary data storage facility. This redundant storage can be done in the internet cloud.
Operations of gliders rely on good internet connectivity and stable power. While the latter is often taken for granted, there will inevitably be times when power is cut to the glider facility and their needs to be contingency plans to continue fulltime operations. This can be done with uninterruptible power supplies in the short term and backup generators for longer outages. The glider team should establish a relationship with another glider operator or the manufacturer to host glider operations at their partner facility should there be extended downtime at one’s own glider facility. Telephone modems can be used as backup communications channels in the event the internet is unavailable. A modem capability should include multiple modems and/or a phone tree structure if the glider facility is operating many gliders at once that may call in nearly simultaneously.
Importantly in this day and age, there must be IT attention to cyberinfrastructure and the secure ability to access the glider facility basestations from outside of the glider facility so that glider operations like piloting can be done remotely. Again, expertise in this field is either needed on the glider team or through the host institution’s IT facility.
Shipping and Insurance
Since gliders are deployed and recovered at locations distant from the glider facility, and need to be sent to the manufacturer for refurbishment or upgrade, the glider team or the host institution should have expertise in shipping. If operations are international, this must include international shipping expertise and knowledge of customs and entry/exit requirements for equipment. Because many gliders use lithium batteries, there must be expertise on the safe shipping of these batteries including having a person certified to handle hazardous materials and dangerous goods. This expertise extends to proper storage and disposal of hazardous materials like lithium batteries at the glider facility. Use of a commercial shipper can be avoided if the glider operations region is accessible by land. In that case, access to a dedicated glider transport vehicle or access to rented vehicles are needed. In all cases, attention should be paid to making sure the gliders are insured during their time in shipment after leaving the glider facility.
Depending on the size of the glider facility and the number of gliders it has available to conduct glider operations, it may be advantageous to insure the gliders at sea. If the facility has an adequate number of gliders to replace those lost at sea, or they are “self insured,” there is no need for outside insurance. However, many small glider operators have only a few gliders that are precious to maintaining operations. Some institutions support over-the-side insurance programs or a glider operator may seek insurance from a variety of maritime insurance companies. It also may be advantageous for glider operators to pool their glider resources for insurance purposes so as to obtain a favorable insurance policy. This could be pursued among a nation’s glider facilities, for example, or by those glider operations funded by the same national granting agency (e.g., the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).
4. Personnel 
glider team
engineering and technical support (electric/onic, mechanics, IT)...trained by manufacturers and/or major glider operation centers?
diversity of expertise. 
pilots (how many? training? are pilots part of the facility or part of the science team?  is the ‘facility’ staff integrated with the science team?)
how many FTEs, train and hire within lab
do all glider operators need to maintain a full glider facility or better to form partnerships with larger glider labs?
expertise on shipping, insurance, export, customs, IT, engineering/electrical etc.
what is available in terms of expertise from manufacturers, independent glider lab or regional cooperation?
interdisciplinary background help to advance/different expertise 
team coordination, cross-facility coordination
tools and platforms for collaboration - e.g. GitHub
Team sustainability? (things like training requirements, retaining expertise)

A successful glider operation relies on a well-coordinated team with members having a wide variety of skills and experience. The size of the team depends critically on whether the glider facility is a standalone operation or benefits from being hosted at an institution with services mentioned above like Information Technology. The breadth of skills and experience also depends on whether the facility is a science-driven operation led by one or more scientists or is a local, regional or national facility tasked with providing glider services to outside scientists and/or ocean observing operations. No matter the size of the team, the importance of regular and efficient communications amongst team members before, during and after a glider mission cannot be overemphasized. Another key to success is to build a tiered approach in experience and seniority. For example, junior co-principal investigators, postdocs and students may be mentored by senior co-PIs. Junior glider technicians can learn from experienced technicians, and having senior or lead pilots interacting with pilots-in-training are all important. As described in this series of chapters on glider best practices, the team should follow these best practices and, spend the time to document their part of glider operations. Such documentation includes, but is not limited to, glider repair logs, glider metadata, piloting strategies and decisions handed off between pilots during a mission, etc. Lastly, all members of the team should be encouraged to communicate about the glider missions and operations, and to share in the success of a successful mission.
Glider technicians
At the very heart of successful glider operations are experienced and skilled glider technicians. These technicians work on the glider equipment, conducting repairs, refurbishments and upgrades, both in hardware and software. The technicians prepare the gliders for missions by configuring sensor payloads, ballasting to target operational seawater densities, testing communications, and preparing metadata. Importantly, the glider technicians interface with the glider manufacturers to diagnose and solve equipment challenges and accomplish needed refurbishments and upgrades. The technicians conduct post-mission sensor calibrations, for example, on dissolved oxygen sensors described in chapter X.
Glider technicians also lead and conduct field operations. This includes reading and packing any equipment needed at sea, identifying deployment and recovery vessels, and interacting with the captain and crews of these vessels to carry out safe glider operations. The field technician performs on-deck and at-sea tests in coordination with the glider pilot, before a glider is sent on its mission.

6. Communications
expertise on shipping, insurance, export, customs, IT, (Aragon/Waite)  (does this belong in Personnel?)
think of managing people and communication with users
meta facilities that span countries; transnational access (e.g., JERICO)
how to maximize use of gliders
getting the message out about glider capabilities and facilities  (possibly all these four bullets highlighted in yellow belong in the discussion about what type of facility are you setting up, eg national/institution specific)
What is the mode of satellite communication with the glider ? (e.g. most use Iridium but is not easily accessible around the world.  (does this belong in Equipment?)



possible section on pit falls and considerations

Communications between the glider and shore are considered elsewhere in this chapter. Here we suggest the value of thinking ahead about communications related to glider operations. This includes having a 24/7/365 communication channel for receiving contact from any individual who may encounter a non-operating glider at sea or on the beach. It is important to post a cell phone number monitored by the glider operator 24/7/365 along with a message like “Oceanographic Research Equipment: If found adrift, please leave alone. If found ashore, please call X-XX-XXX-XXX-XXXX.” There is considerable value in communicating with ocean users in the glider operations area, for example, meeting with local fishermen to explain the mission of the glider, what it is, and how it works. This communication should include information and even a tutorial about how ocean users can access data from the glider if the data are available to the public. Because of the considerable interest of the public and press in gliders, the glider team should be prepared to communicate about glider operations and the science and monitoring missions. This can happen before, during and after a glider mission. Support for glider operations can be enhanced by effective and frequent communication with the interested public, students and teachers at all levels, policy makers, and natural resource managers.

Some points from previous doc (probably repeat tho): 
physical aspects of the facility itself… benefits to access water
ballast tank requirements
bench equipment, swivel mounting, etc
needs of the facility to undertake full versus partial refurbishments
at sea capability and considerations (seatrials and deployment/recovery cruises - team size, ship based equipment like nets/poles?)

WE THINK THIS BELONGS TO OTHER CHAPTERS, 2 AND 3?  

piloting needs depend on open ocean, coastal ocean operations, current field  (Only a facility consideration if the facility is responsible for piloting for all missions rather than the science team for specific missions.)
How are new proposed missions evaluated and approved - requires a decision-making relationship between external PI, program PI, PMs and glider engineers and pilots.  
Platforms to enable deployments: Ship, medium boats … ; partnerships for deploying/recovering gliders.  (Only a facility consideration if the facility organises deployment and recovery, rather than that being part of a specific mission and thus organised by PI.  Though the facility could maintain a list of local boat contacts if running local missions.)
real-time response to events (heat waves/coral bleaching events, hurricanes, hypoxia, HAB, …)
consideration of ship traffic including navy and fisheries (AIS receiver system)? 
availability of deployment/recovery platforms - both planned and emergency (Only a facility consideration if the facility organises deployment and recovery, rather than that being part of a specific mission and thus organised by PI.  Though the facility could maintain a list of local boat contacts if running local missions.)  [CONSIDER HOW THIS FITS WITH PRE-DEPLOYMENT/OPERATIONS CHAPTERS]
contingency planning for emergencies (list of vessels; pre-approval of charter vessels for safety; community engagement may be required eg. to inform local fishing fleet (Only a facility consideration if the facility organises deployment and recovery, rather than that being part of a specific mission and thus organised by PI.  Though the facility could maintain a list of local boat contacts if running local missions.)  [CONSIDER HOW THIS FITS WITH PRE-DEPLOYMENT/OPERATIONS CHAPTERS] .  [Do programs need a Safety Management Plan from the outset]
what is the expected turn around time for servicing and shipping to/from missions and sensor calibrations etc? 
Optimal sensor configurations for different mission goals (carbon/chlorophyll biomass/acoustics/underwater light/physics/coastal vs. open ocean)

# Report on progresses
The initial group formed in 2018 was pretty large with 111 members reachable through the Task team mailing list (og-dm@jcommops.org) and gathered around the slack channel [https://oceangliderdmtt.slack.com](https://oceangliderdmtt.slack.com).
It is worth saying that the mailing list and the stalck channel are not often used since about 2 years.

4 working groups emerged at the early stage of the task team.
* Format harmonization
* BUFR format
* Real Time QC
* Delayed Time QC. 

While Format harmonization and BUFR format working group achieved their objective (see paragraph below), the Real Time QC and the delayed time QC did not progress much.

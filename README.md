# Meeting notes

This repo is build to store meeting notes to allow people from the OceanGlidersCommunity to better follow the meeting discussions. 
Please support this collective documentation.

If you are having a meeting on OceanGliders relevant topics feel free to use this infrastructure! 

The process: 
1) Use [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) collectively during the meeting. 
2) Clean up the HackMD file collectively towards the end of the meeting
3) Export the *.md file and upload it here
